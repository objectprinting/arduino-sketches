Some various Arduino sketches.

When I learn software for drawing schematics I'll post 'em with the sketches, one of these years…

Fade Two Pins Async:
This sketch is similar to PWM example at Arduino.cc, except that it operates two LEDs simultaneously.  The circuit to test this is basically two LEDs connected to different Arduino digital IO pins - don't forget the resistor - with both LEDs grounded to the Arduino.

Siren Lights:
Could also be called "Fade Two Pins Async with Potentiometer".  This sketch is just like above, except 'fadeIncrement' is set by analog IO pin A2.
