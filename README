Some various Arduino sketches.

--------------------
Fade Two Pins Async:
This sketch is similar to PWM example at Arduino.cc (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM), except that it operates two LEDs simultaneously.  The circuit to test this is basically two LEDs connected to different Arduino digital IO pins - don't forget the resistor - with both LEDs grounded to the Arduino.

Siren Lights:
Could also be called "Fade Two Pins Async with Potentiometer".  This sketch is just like above, except 'fadeIncrement' is set by analog IO pin A2.
